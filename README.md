# Introduction 

For this challenge we find out that the data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so she asked us to group the cryptocurrencies. We have been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.In this project we used unsupervised machine larning to anlayze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified into clusters based on their features. This report could be used to categorize different currencies being traded in the market for further analysis.

## Summary 
Looking at the above results we can say that Using the final PCA dataframe, we performed K-means clustering to categorize the data into 4 classes. We ended up at 4 clusters by utilizing the elbow curve. The analysis also tells us that finally we have identified the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features. Particularities of each group need to be analyzed to determine their performance and potential interest for further investment.
